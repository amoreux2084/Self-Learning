2. Select device screen size on the right
3. Insert shape for buttons
4. Look at Prototype vs. a Design mode
5. Add interaction between shapes by clicking on "+" button on the right of the shape
6. Add a backward relationaship between shapes if needed
7. Use preview button to check how it works
8. Create a non-linear navigation
9. Drag noodle from navigation button to the prototype screen
10. Add a Simple Scroll feature to your prototype (clip content to hide the scrolling content)
11. Fixed behavior if you want to have a menu that does not move when you scroll
12. Use Auto-Layout if you need to group different objects that later will be scrolling. Apply vertical or horizontal scroll (->). 
13. Animations: aloow to combine several components in one prototype. 
14. Create 2 draggers (Off and On) and establish the connections (On drag)
15. Make those Draggers reusable: select them both, create component set (they become purple)
16. Use "Auto-delay" to create animations
